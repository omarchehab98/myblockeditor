# ev3-myblockeditor

This project is for educational purposes only, it demonstrates parsing and refactoring a programming language expressed in XML.

To avoid copyright infringement the assets folder is omitted from this repository. It is taken from LEGO's EV3 Mindstorms Programming Software.

This web application fills in the gaps of LEGO's Programming Software, it introduces My Block Refactoring.

A My Block is the equivalent of `function`. The only way to modify a My Block's parameters is to delete it and create it again, which causes all the wiring to mess up.

It allows users to upload their `.ev3` source file, rename My Blocks, change the desciption of My Blocks, change the icon of My Blocks, add parameters, remove parameters, change the data type of parameters, change the icon of parameters, and change the handle of integers.
